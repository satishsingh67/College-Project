                <p>
                    I chose the Computer Science department which had equipped me with the skills to learn any emerging technologies. The faculty members were beyond amazing and helpful. They used images, examples while teaching, which helped me get a clear picture of any topic.

                    The Autonomous Syllabus really helps me to get job in these companies. It is a well-maintained college where the main focus has always been to nurture the student’s growth.

                    The placement is good enough. Almost 80% of the students get placed. The top recruiting companies are ITC, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini, Prolifics etc. Even in the case of placement, our faculty members are very supportive like Ipshita Mam, Shraboni maam, Rafiqul Sir, Nirupam Sir, MD Sir and all the other teachers. The teachers of CSE Dept are really very much helpful, well qualified and knowledgeable.
