            <h3>ECE DEPARTMENT...</h3>
           <p class="cse-text">
            The Electronics and Communications Department commenced in the year 2003 and now runs one undergraduate, one postgraduate program (M. Tech in Communication), Ph. D. program under JIS University/MAKAUT and also one 3 years diploma program affiliated by WBSCTE. The programs offered by the department are the most sought after branch in Engineering by top WBJEE rank holders and other aspirants from across the country. All the programs are accredited by NAAC the undergraduate program is accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) which is compulsorily outcome based, planned to meet the Industry needs and also Research organization. The program contents are upgraded on annual basis with involvement from industry experts, academia and reputed research institutions.

            Experienced faculty members all of whom are engineering postgraduates and most of them with PhDs as well, support three core specializations (VLSI & Microelectronics, Communication, Image processing & Embedded system) in the Department. The curriculum includes a strong self-study component and mini projects at all levels so as to develop the studentsâ€™ independent analytical abilities. Opportunity for innovation and incubation is provided at this stage to successful projects by the institute for industrial standards. The department offers financial support to its young faculty for cutting edge research and also encourages them to undertake sponsored research from industry and government agencies. Presently several projects sponsored by UGC, AICTE are under way in the department. Also, department provides healthy environment to students and faculties to carry out inter department collaborative research in area like robotics, human computer interface, SMART sensor etc. Software Simulation environment (MATLAB, Ansoft HFSS, ORIGIN Tanner EDA Tools, FPGA, Intellisuite, COMSOL, VISSIM etc.) and state of the art are available.
            
            Having undergone such a robust academic program under the supervision of highest quality faculty members, all passing out students of the department are capable of envisage, planning and developing big projects of commercial and research interests in their respective field of expertise.

                <p>
                    Being a student of the Electronics and Communication Engineering department, it was a dream to be placed as a Radio Frequency Engineer in Amdocs. During the journey, my department itself encouraged me to enrich my knowledge and enhanced my skill sets. The hands-on training and lab classes gave clarity to complex topics on Electronics. Along with two friends, we had published a paper in International Journal using Embedded technology for Women Safety Device. This initiative seeded a researcher mentality inside me. The best thing about the department is the faculty members are always available. Sometimes our research works were extended beyond the class hours

                    I would like to convey my regards to the college along with my department faculties. I would like to show my heartfelt gratitude towards my teachers and T& P cell for guiding me to this success. From teaching me to advising me on academic matters and life, teachers were always beside me. Apart from the academic curriculum, they have always encouraged me to take part in extracurricular activities like sports, fest, tech events, etc which helped me to boost my leadership qualities.

                    Our college has an amazing campus full of greeneries and very helpful, approachable faculties who give their best in teaching. The research and publication opportunities are also in plenty along with different electronic and coding competitions (Annual Tech Fest included). I have published many papers in conference and journals. Our Training and Placement (T and P) cell is very active with job openings not only on-campus but also off-campus. It has been really helpful

                    I would like to thank this institution that has given me the prosperous opportunity to spend such excellent years to flourish my knowledge and to meet some of the finest people of their time. I am also indebted to the cheering faculty members of my department for filling me up with such enthusiasm over the years. I would certainly like to convey my heartfelt obligations to my departmental seniors who have been the kindest beings in this brief journey.
