           <p class="cse-text">
            Hospital Management is a new concept in management stream. Gone are the days when a senior doctor was generally responsible for the role of a hospital manager. For the smooth functioning of a hospital, qualified professionals are required. As a consequence, several courses and training programs have been developed to churn out professional hospital mangers. A Hospital administrator is overall in charge of administrative affairs of the hospital. He takes over the charge of various aspects of health administration and hospital administration with respect to patients and healthcare.

            <br>
            After completion of this course, students can take up masters or postgraduate programs. Some of the programs that can be undertaken are MBA in Hospital Management, Masters in Hospital Administration (MHA), PGDM Hospital Management and PG Certificate in Quality Management & Accreditation. There are also scope for undertaking doctorate programs like M.Phil and PhD after post graduation.

                    I chose the Computer Science department which had equipped me with the skills to learn any emerging technologies. The faculty members were beyond amazing and helpful. They used images, examples while teaching, which helped me get a clear picture of any topic.

                    The Autonomous Syllabus really helps me to get job in these companies. It is a well-maintained college where the main focus has always been to nurture the student’s growth.

                    The placement is good enough. Almost 80% of the students get placed. The top recruiting companies are ITC, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini, Prolifics etc. Even in the case of placement, our faculty members are very supportive like Ipshita Mam, Shraboni maam, Rafiqul Sir, Nirupam Sir, MD Sir and all the other teachers. The teachers of CSE Dept are really very much helpful, well qualified and knowledgeable.
