            reach the top. In addition to the curriculum, the department in association with IE chapter and IIC cell conducts regular value-added course, soft skill programs, seminars, and webinars with the help of quailed resource person from India and abroad to meet the ever-changing needs of employ-ability. This helps the highly motivated students to understand the dynamics of the industry and to upgrade their skills for higher studies and research and development activities. During curriculum all the students enroll for multiple in-house and industry ready trainings, MOOC courses through which they can enhance their skill. As a result many of them get paid

                    I chose the Computer Science department which had equipped me with the skills to learn any emerging technologies. The faculty members were beyond amazing and helpful. They used images, examples while teaching, which helped me get a clear picture of any topic.

                    The Autonomous Syllabus really helps me to get job in these companies. It is a well-maintained college where the main focus has always been to nurture the student’s growth.

                    The placement is good enough. Almost 80% of the students get placed. The top recruiting companies are ITC, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini, Prolifics etc. Even in the case of placement, our faculty members are very supportive like Ipshita Mam, Shraboni maam, Rafiqul Sir, Nirupam Sir, MD Sir and all the other teachers. The teachers of CSE Dept are really very much helpful, well qualified and knowledgeable.
