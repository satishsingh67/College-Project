                            almost each hostel has a mess of its own, run by the university administration
                             together with students' participation. There is a student Mess Secretary post, for 
                             which every month a student is elected and whose job is to decide the menu and maintain
                              the quality of food in such a way that the expenses (per day) do not go beyond a critical value. 
                              The usual 'basic' per day for 3 meals (breakfast, lunch & dinner). That said, the menu for all
                               the 3 meals 
                              depends on the day of the week. For lunch and dinner, Dal and Sambar or Rasam are served on
                               all days of the week, with the curry or fry varying based on the day of the week.
